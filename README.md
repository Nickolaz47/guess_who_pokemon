# Guess Who Pokémon

>This app is based on a classic Guess Who game, but with a Pokémon theme. 

## How to play
---
1. Access this link [Guess Who Pokémon](https://nickolaz47.github.io/guess_who_pokemon/);
2. On the home screen you will see two main components: the menu and the cards;
3. The menu accumulates the main functions from filtering the Pokémon based on the selected filter as well as the feedback of the guessed trait and the remaining Pokémon;
4. On the other hand, the cards tell you which Pokémon are left as well as the characteristics of each one when the mouse is above the card;
5. To start the game just select an option within one of the six filters and then click on the filter out button;
6. Repeat this filtering process and eventually if you hit a characteristic, it will appear in the right answers field;
7. At any time it is possible to try to guess the right pokemon by clicking on the I choose you button;
8. After clicking on the I choose you button, a feedback will appear above the restart button informing you if the pokemon chosen was the correct one;
9. If you want to start over the game at any time, just click on the restart button;
10. Due to the randomness of the game, sometimes only one pokémon can be left at the end as well as more than one pokémon with the same characteristics;
